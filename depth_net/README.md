# DEPTH MAPS

 so I have two research papers for depth maps 
 1. DEEPV2D: VIDEO TO DEPTH WITH DIFFERENTIABLE STRUCTURE FROM MOTION
 2. Consistent Video Depth Estimation

FUck those papers go with 
  1. https://ml4ad.github.io/files/papers2020/DepthNet%20Nano:%20A%20Highly%20Compact%20Self-Normalizing%20Neural%20Network%20for%20Monocular%20Depth%20Estimation.pdf
  2. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06556.pdf

look into these papers and make a working model from these ! train on KITTI dataset 

https://github.com/ClementPinard/DepthNet
look at this as a reference 

a better implimentation with code? 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01341v3.pdf
