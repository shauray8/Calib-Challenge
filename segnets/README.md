# Some sick segmentations live here 

```
 1 - #402020 - road (all parts, anywhere nobody would look at you funny for driving)
 2 - #ff0000 - lane markings (don't include non lane markings like turn arrows and crosswalks)
 3 - #808060 - undrivable
 4 - #00ff66 - movable (vehicles and people/animals)
 5 - #cc00ff - my car (and anything inside it, including wires, mounts, etc. No reflections)
```

### DATA
Data is a hybrid between what [comma10k](https://github.com/commaai/comma10k) dataset provides and what i have collected in recent times(maybe i'll opensource it in comming weeks).
</br>
Comma10k is a collection of 10,000 PNGs of real driving captured from the comma fleet.
