writing all the stuff about U square net here straight from the research paper

U2-Net is a two-level nested U-structure that isdesigned for SOD without using any pre-trained backbonesfrom  image  classification.

It is a two level nested U-structure.
advantages -- 
  it is able to capture more contextural information from different scales 
  it increses the depth of the whole architecture without significantly increasing the computational cost because of the pooling operations used in these RSU blocks.

  
we design a novel ReSidual U-block(RSU), which is able to extract intra-stage multi-scale fea-tures without degrading the feature map resolution

A3×3filter is good for extracting local features ateach laye

Inspired by U-Net [34], we propose a novelReSidualU-block,RSU, to capture intra-stage multi-scale features

structure of the network -->
  1. an input convolution layer,  which transforms the inputfeature mapx(H×W×Cin) to an intermediate mapF1(x)with channel ofCout. This is a plain convolutional layer forlocal feature extraction

  2. a U-Net like symmetric encoder-decoder structure withheight ofLwhich takes the intermediate feature mapF1(x)as  input  and  learns  to  extract  and  encode  the  multi-scalecontextual informationU(F1(x))

  3. The multi-scale features are extracted from gradu-ally downsampled feature maps and encoded into high reso-lution feature maps by progressive upsampling, concatena-tion and convolution

  4. a residual connection which fuses local features and themulti-scale features by the summation:F1(x) +U(F1(x))



Adam optimizer is used to train 
optimal batch size = 12
optimal iterations = 600k
time it took on GTX 1080ti = 120 hours  (i'm plannig to train this thing on google cloud !) 

Augmentations -->
  1. adding soon
